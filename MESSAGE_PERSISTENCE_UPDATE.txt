ðŸ”„ MESSAGE PERSISTENCE UPDATE - COMPLETED
==========================================

âœ… WHAT'S NEW:
- Messages now persist throughout the entire server session
- Switching between conversations keeps all message history
- Messages only disappear when you restart the server
- Both public and private messages are fully persistent

ðŸ§  HOW IT WORKS:
================

SERVER SIDE (already working):
- sessionMessages.public[] - stores all public messages
- sessionMessages.private[] - stores all private messages  
- Sends all relevant messages to users when they login

CLIENT SIDE (newly enhanced):
- allPublicMessages[] - stores all public messages received
- allPrivateMessages[] - stores all private messages received
- Messages persist when switching conversations
- Smart duplicate prevention

ðŸ”§ KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
===================

1. PERSISTENT STORAGE:
   - Messages stored in arrays that persist during session
   - No more clearing messages when switching chats
   - Duplicate message prevention

2. SMART CONVERSATION SWITCHING:
   - Public chat: Shows ALL public messages from session
   - Private chat: Shows ALL messages with that specific user
   - Messages stay visible when switching back and forth

3. SEAMLESS USER EXPERIENCE:
   - Login: Receives full message history from server
   - Chat switching: Instantly loads relevant messages
   - New messages: Added to persistent storage automatically

ðŸ“‹ TESTING CHECKLIST:
====================

âœ… Send public messages - should persist when switching chats
âœ… Send private messages - should persist in conversation
âœ… Switch between public/private - messages should remain
âœ… Have multiple private conversations - each keeps its history
âœ… New users joining should see all previous messages
âœ… Messages only clear when server restarts

ðŸŽ¯ RESULT:
=========
Your messenger now has full session persistence! Messages stay visible throughout the entire session and only disappear when you turn off the server (node server.js).

ðŸ’¡ BONUS FEATURES:
=================
- Debug function: clearAllStoredMessages() - use in browser console to manually clear all messages
- Message IDs for better tracking and duplicate prevention
- Optimized message loading for better performance
