üåê MESSENGER SHARING GUIDE - How to let friends access your chat app
===============================================================================

Your messenger app is running on YOUR computer, so friends need a way to reach it.
Here are 3 ways to make this work:

üìç OPTION 1: SAME WIFI NETWORK (EASIEST)
------------------------------------------
If your friends are on the same WiFi as you:

1. Find your local IP address:
   - Windows: Open Command Prompt and type: ipconfig
   - Look for "IPv4 Address" (like 192.168.1.100)

2. Share this URL with friends:
   http://[YOUR_LOCAL_IP]:3000
   Example: http://192.168.1.100:3000

üöÄ OPTION 2: NGROK (RECOMMENDED FOR INTERNET)
----------------------------------------------
This creates a tunnel to your computer without router setup:

1. Install ngrok:
   npm install -g ngrok

2. Start ngrok (keep this running):
   ngrok http 3000

3. Copy the HTTPS URL ngrok gives you (like https://abc123.ngrok.io)

4. Share that URL with friends anywhere on the internet!

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep the ngrok window open while friends use the app.

üîß OPTION 3: ROUTER PORT FORWARDING (ADVANCED)
-----------------------------------------------
For permanent internet access:

1. Find your public IP: Go to whatismyipaddress.com

2. Access your router admin:
   - Open browser to 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1
   - Login with admin credentials

3. Set up port forwarding:
   - External Port: 3000
   - Internal Port: 3000  
   - Internal IP: Your computer's local IP
   - Protocol: TCP

4. Share: http://[YOUR_PUBLIC_IP]:3000

‚ö†Ô∏è This opens your computer to the internet - use carefully!

üõ°Ô∏è FIREWALL SETUP (Windows)
-----------------------------
Allow the app through Windows Firewall:

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall"
3. Click "Change Settings" then "Allow another app"
4. Browse to your Node.js installation or add port 3000

OR run in Command Prompt as Administrator:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Messenger App" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000

üîç QUICK DIAGNOSIS
------------------
If friends still can't connect:

1. ‚úÖ Can YOU access http://localhost:3000 ?
2. ‚úÖ Is the server running (no errors in console)?
3. ‚úÖ Have you shared the correct URL?
4. ‚úÖ Is Windows Firewall allowing the connection?
5. ‚úÖ Are you and friends using the same method (local network vs internet)?

üí° EASIEST SOLUTION: USE NGROK
-------------------------------
Most users find ngrok is the simplest option because:
- No router configuration needed
- Works from anywhere on the internet
- Provides secure HTTPS connection
- Free for basic use

Just run: ngrok http 3000
Then share the https:// URL it gives you!

Need help? Check the console output when you start the server - it shows
all available connection methods automatically.
